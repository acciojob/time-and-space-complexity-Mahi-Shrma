	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Space and Time define any physical 
		object in the Universe. Similarly, Space and Time 
		complexity can define the effectiveness of an algorithm.
		While we know there is more than one way to solve the problem in
		programming, knowing how the algorithm works efficiently can add 
		value to the way we do programming. To find the effectiveness of the 
		program/algorithm, knowing how to evaluate them using Space and Time 
		complexity can make the program behave in required optimal conditions,
		and by doing so, it makes us efficient programmers.</p>
	<p>You might have heard of this term, ,<b>Space Complexity</b>, 
		that hovers around when talking about time complexity. What is Space 
		Complexity? Well, it is the working space or storage that is required by 
		any algorithm. It is directly dependent or proportional to the amount of input that the algorithm takes. To calculate space complexity, all you have to do is calculate the space taken up by the variables in an algorithm. The lesser space, the faster the algorithm executes. It is also important to know
		that time and space complexity are not related to each other. An algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity when the running time increases linearly with the length of the input. When the function involves checking all the values in input data, with this order O(n). </p>
